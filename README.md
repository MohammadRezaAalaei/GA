## Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm from scratch
In this project, I wrote a Genetic Algorithm from Scratch and connected it to Rhinoceros software and the Grasshopper plugin to translate the genomes of particles into geometrical features. This algorithm is useful for a wide range of continuous optimization tasks. Grasshopper must include the problem and the cost function.
