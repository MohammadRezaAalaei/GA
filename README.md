## Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm from scratch
In this project, I wrote a Genetic Algorithm from Scratch and connected it to Rhinoceros software and the Grasshopper plugin to translate the genomes of particles into geometrical features. This algorithm is useful for a wide range of continuous optimization tasks. Grasshopper must include the problem and the cost function.

In the Problem-definition module, the loss function and hyperparameters have been specified. The agent-definition module is devoted to particle class definition, and the GA module provides the Genetic Algorithm class and runs the program.
